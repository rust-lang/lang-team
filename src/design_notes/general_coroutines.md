# Generalized coroutines

Since even before Rust 1.0, users have desired the ability to `yield` like in
other languages. The compiler infrastructure to achieve this, along with an
unstable syntax, have existed for a while now. But despite *a lot* of debate,
we've failed to polish the feature up enough to stabilize it. I've tried to
write up a summary of the different design considerations and the past debate
around them below:

## Terminology

- The distinction between a "coroutine" and a "generator" can be a bit vague,
  varying from one discussion to the next.
- In these notes a generator is anything which *directly* implements `Iterator`
  or `Stream` while a coroutine is anything which can take arbitrary input,
  yield arbitrary output, and later resume execution at the previous yield.
- Thus, the "generator" syntax proposed in [eRFC-2033][1] and currently
  implemented behind the "generator" feature is actually a coroutine syntax for
  the sake of these notes, *not a true generator*.
  - [RFC-2996][4] defines a true generator syntax in "future additions".
- Note also that "coroutines" here are really "semicoroutines" since they can
  only yield back to their caller.
- I will continue to group the [original eRFC text][1] and the later [generator
  resume arguments](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/68524) extension
  togther as "[eRFC-2033][1]". That way I only have 3 big proposals to deal
  with.
- In rustc, a coroutine's "witness" is the space where stack-allocated values
  are stored if needed across yields. I'm borrowing this terminology here. Any
  such cross-yield bindings are said to be "witnessed".

```rust,ignore
// This is an example coroutine which might assist a streaming base64 encoder
|sextet, octets| {
    let a = sextet; // witness a, b, and c sextets for later use
    yield;
    let b = sextet;
    octets.push(a << 2 | b >> 4); // aaaaaabb
    yield;
    let c = sextet;
    octets.push((b & 0b1111) << 4 | c >> 2); // bbbbcccc
    yield;
    octets.push((c & 0b11) << 6 | sextet) // ccdddddd
}

// This is an example generator which might be used in Iterator::flat_map.
gen {
  for item in inner {
    for mapped in func(item) {
      yield mapped;
    }
  }
}

// This is an example async generator which might be used in Stream::and_then
async gen {
  while let Some(item) = inner.next().await {
    yield func(item).await;
  }
}
```

## Coroutine trait

- The coroutine syntax must produce implementations of some trait.
- [RFC-2781][2] and [eRFC-2033][1] propose the `Generator` trait.
- Note that Rust's coroutines and subroutines look the same from the outside:
  take input, mutate state, produce output.
- Thus, [MCP-49][3] proposes using the `Fn*` traits instead, including a new
  `FnPin` for immovable coroutines.
  - Hierarchy: `Fn` is `FnMut + Unpin` is `FnPin` is `FnOnce`.
    - May not be *required* at the trait level (someone may someday find a use
      to implementing `FnMut + !FnPin`) but all closures implement the traits in
      this order.

## Coroutine syntax

- The closure syntax is reused for coroutines by [eRFC-2033][1], [RFC-2781][2],
  and [MCP-49][3].
- Commentators have suggested that the differences between coroutines and
  closures under [eRFC-2033][1] and [RFC-2781][2] justify an entirely distinct
  syntax to reduce confusion.
- [MCP-49][3] fully reuses the *semantics* of closures, greatly simplifying the
  design space and making the shared syntax obvious.

## Taking input

- The major disagreement between past proposals is whether to use "yield
  expressions" or "magic mutation".
  - Yield expression: `let after = yield output;`
    - Used by [eRFC-2033][1] and is the current implementation.
  - Magic mutation: `let before = arg; yield output; let after = arg;`
    - Used by [RFC-2781][2] and [MCP-49][3]
- Many people have a strong gut preference for yield expressions.
  - In simple cases, Rust generally prefers to produce values as output from
    expressions rather than by mutation of state. "Yield expressions *feel* more
    Rusty."
  - However, magic mutation is likely correct, even though at first glance it
    feels surprising. In addition to reasons below, holding references to past
    resume args is rare, often a logic error. Rust can use mutation checks to
    catch and give feedback.
- "Magic mutation" is a bit of a misnomer. The resume argument values are *not
  themselves being mutated.* The argument bindings are simply being reassigned
  across yields.
  - In a sense, argument bindings are reassigned in the exact same way across
  returns.
  - Previous arguments (if unmoved) are dropped prior to yielding and are
    reassigned after resuming.
  - People will get yelled at by the borrow checker if they try to hold borrows
    of arguments across yields. But the fix is generally easy: move the argument
    to a new binding before yielding.
```text
=> |x| {
    let y = &x;
    yield;
    dbg!(y, x);
}

error[E0506]: cannot pass new `x` because it is borrowed
 --> src/lib.rs:3:4
  |
2 |     let y = &x;
  |             -- borrow of `x` occurs here
3 |     yield;
  |     ^^^^^ assignment to borrowed `x` occurs here
4 |     dbg!(y, x);
  |             - borrow later used here
  |
  = help: consider moving `x` into a new binding before borrowing

=> |x| {
    let a = x;
    let y = &a;
    yield;
    dbg!(y, x);
}
```
- Magic mutation could be replaced by "magic shadowing" where new arguments
  shadow old ones at yield in order to allow easy borrowing of past argument
  values. But this is a huge footgun. See if you can spot the issue with the
  following code if `ctx` shadows its past value rather than overwriting it:
```rust,ignore
std::future::from_fn(|ctx| {
  if is_blocked() {
    register_waker(ctx);
    yield Pending;
  }

  while let Pending = task.poll(ctx) { .. }
})
```
- "Yield expression" causes problems with first-resume input.
  - [eRFC-2033][1] passes the first resume argument via a closure parameters
    while later arguments are produced by `yield` expressions.
  - This part of why it is so hard to unify generalized coroutines with a
    generator syntax like `gen { }` or `gen fn`. Where does the first input go?
    Where do you annotate the argument type even?
- To increase clarity, users almost always want resume arguments to be named.
  - With magic mutation, all resume arguments are already named since they reuse
    the closures arguments on every resume. Any unmoved arguments are dropped
    just prior to yielding, so they are not witnessed and do not increase the
    coroutine size.
    - Also get multiple arguments for free if using the `Fn*` traits.
  - Yield expressions require users to repeatedly assign resume arguments to
    named bindings manually. Such bindings must be included in the closure state
    if they have any drop logic.

## Borrowed resume arguments

- What happens when a coroutine witnesses a borrow passed as a resume argument?
  For example:
```rust,ignore
let co = |x: &i32| {
  let mut values = Vec::new();
  loop {
    values.push(x);
    yield;
  }
};

// potentially ok:
let mut x = 0;
co(&x);

// must not be allowed:
x = 1;
co(&x);
```
- As of writing, [RFC-2781][2] leaves this as an unresolved question with a note
  to potentially restrict resume arguments to being `'static`.
- Since coroutines under [MCP-49][2] act as much like closures as possible, and
  treat the witness and capture data the same whenever possible, the example
  above would fail in a similar way to the example below, giving a "borrowed
  data escapes into closure state" error or similar even if `x` is not mutated.
```rust,ignore
let mut values = Vec::new();
|x: &i32| {
  loop {
    values.push(x);
//  ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ `x` escapes the closure body here
    yield;
  }
}
```
- As of writing, [eRFC-2033][1] appears to take a similar approach (although the
  error message is not super descriptive).
- Ideally someday we'd do something nicer but any such solution would apply to both captured state and witnessed state in the same way.

## Lending

- Coroutines would eventually like to yield borrows of state to the caller. This
  is "lending" coroutine (sometimes also called an "attached" coroutine).
- Using [MCP-49][3], a lending coroutine might look like:
```rust,ignore
|| {
  let mut buffer = Vec::new();
  loop {
    let n = fill_buffer(&mut buffer);
    yield &buffer[..n];
  }
}
```
- None of the major proposals have made an effort to resolve this directly as
  far as I am aware.
  - [RFC-2996][4] gets the closest with a mention of `LendingStream` and
    `LendingIterator` traits in "future additions".
  - We should probably get some experience with lending traits at the lib level
    before attempting to add language level support.
- If lending closures were implemented, [MCP-49][3] could immediately be used to
  build lending streams, iterators, etc so long as the respective traits have
  the needed GAT-ification.

## Enum-wrapping

- [RFC-2781][2] and [eRFC-2033][1] propose that `yield x` should produce
  `GeneratorState::Yielded(x)` or equivalent as an output, in order to
  discriminate between yielded and returned values.
- [MCP-49][3] instead gives `yield x` and `return x` nearly identical semantics
  and output `x` directly, so the two must return the same type.
- Enum-wrapping here is analogous to Ok-wrapping elsewhere. Similar debates
  result.
- When using enum-wrapping, the syntax to specify distinct return/yield types is
  hotly debated.
- Generators always want return and yield to have different types (`()` vs `T`)
  but a generator syntax on top of coroutines could be used to auto-insert enum
  wrappers around yield vs return arguments.
- Auto-enum-wrapping can slightly improve type safety in some cases where
`return` should be treated specially to avoid bugs.
- No-enum-wrapping when combined with the `impl Fn*` choice of trait, allow
  the coroutine syntax to be used directly with existing higher-order methods
  on iterator, stream, collection types, async traits, etc.
- Note these two approaches are "isomorphic": a coroutine that returns
  `GeneratorState<T, T>` could be wrapped to return `T` by some sort of
  combinator and a coroutine that only returns `T` can have `yield` and `return`
  values manually wrapped in `GeneratorState`. This is just about ergonomics:
```rust,ignore
// Without enum wrapping:
std::iter::from_fn(|| {
  yield Some(1);
  yield Some(2);
  yield Some(3);
  None
}).map(|x| {
  yield -x;
  yield x;
});

// With enum wrapping:
std::iter::from_gen_fn(|| {
  yield 1;
  yield 2;
  yield 3;
}).map(unwrap_gen_state(|x| {
  yield -x;
  yield x;
}));

// Needed for un-enum-wrapping when not desired.
// Could be replaced by sufficiently fancy !-casting?
fn unwrap_gen_state<T>(f: impl FnMut() -> GeneratorState<T, !>) -> T { ... }
fn merge_gen_state<T>(f: impl FnMut() -> GeneratorState<T, T>) -> T { ... }

// With no wrapping + generators:
(gen {
  yield 1;
  yield 2;
  yield 3;
}).map(|x| {
  yield -x;
  yield x;
})
```

## Movability

- All proposals want movability/`impl Unpin` to be inferred.
  - If we forbid "borrowed data escaping into closure state", the inference
    rules should be relatively simple: witnessing any borrow triggers
    immovability.
    - Dead borrows should not be witnessed.
  - But exact inference rules may only be well understood after an attempt at
    implementation.
- Soundness of `pin_mut!` is a little tricky but seems to be fine no matter what.
  - If the resulting mutable borrow is witnessed ⇒ coroutine is `!Unpin` because
    of inference rules
  - If the pinned data is `!Unpin` and is witnessed ⇒ coroutine is `!Unpin`
    because witness contains `!Unpin` data
  - Thus, if the coroutine can be moved after resume, any data stack-pinned
    (really witness-pinned) by `pin_mut!` is not referenced and is `Unpin`.
- Until inference is solved, the `static` keyword can be used as a modifier.

```rust,ignore
// movable via inference
|| {
  let x = 4;
  let y = &x;
  dbg!(y);
  yield;
}

// guaranteed movable (pending inference)
static || {
  ...
}

// immovable
|| {
  let x = 4;
  let y = &x;
  yield;
  dbg!(y);
}
```

## "Once" coroutines

- A lot of coroutines destroy captured data when run.
- These coroutines (notably futures) can be resumed many times but can only be
  run through "once".
- In contrast to non-yield `FnOnce` closures, this can not be solved at the type
  level because a coroutine can run out after an arbitrary, runtime-dependent
  number of resumptions.
  - Attempts to discriminate with enums tend to run up against `Pin`.
- Coroutines must have the ability to block restart with a `panic!`.
  - Following `return`.
  - Following `panic!` and recovery.
  - The term "poison state" technically refers to only the later case. But here
    I will use it to mean any state at which the closure panics if resumed.
- [RFC-2781][2] and [eRFC-2033][1] propose that all coroutines become poisoned
  after returning.
- [MCP-49][3] recommends that all non-capture-destroying coroutines resume at
  their initial state after returning.
  - This can be very handy in some situations. In fact, I use it several times
    in examples to increase readability. See anywhere I `iter.map(coroutine)` or
    the base64 encoder.
  - Similar question around generators: should they loop to save on a state or
    should they be fused-by-default?
  - If we do decide to panic-after-return, restart-after-return can still be
    emulated using `loop { .. }` as the coroutine body instead of simply `{ ..
    }`. This is even zero-cost because unreachable poison states are eliminated.
- [MCP-49][3] also optionally proposes that capture-destroying closures should
  only implement `FnOnce` unless explicitly annotated, even if they should
  apparently be resumable several times.
  - `mut || { drop(capture); }` is recommended as the modifier, to hint that an
    `FnMut` impl is being requested when the closure in question would otherwise
    impl only `FnOnce`.
  -  But the behavior of this modifier is probably too obscure and requires
      too much explanation vs "closures always impl FnMut/FnPin if they contain
      yield".

## Async coroutines

- I am aware of no strong proposal for an async version of generalized
  coroutines although a fair amount of discussion has taken place.
  - In the context of [MCP-49][3], how should `async || { ... yield ...}` be
    handled in the very long-term? *Error right now.*
- Async coroutines don't make much sense because of resume arguments. Async
  functions are already coroutines which take an `&mut Context` as a resume
  argument. How should additional arguments should be specified?
  - Do the additional args need to be passed every single poll or are they only
    needed when resuming after `Ready`?
  - If they are stored between `Ready`s, how does that interact with the ban on
    witnessing external borrows? Badly.
  - On resume, the the coroutine might only take the additional arguments. It
    could then yield a future to take the async context and handle any `Pending`
    yields.
  - If so, how is the coroutine body broken up into distinct futures to be
    yielded?
  - What happens if a yielded future is destroyed early? Panic on resume?
- Generators and async are both sugars on top of coroutines and are orthogonal
  to each other. But neither is orthogonal to the underlying coroutine feature:
```rust,ignore
// an async block
async {
  "hello"
}

// an async generator
async gen {
  yield "hello";
}

// an "async coroutine"
|ctx: &mut Context| {
  yield Poll::Ready("hello");
}
```
- Taking the async context explicitly makes it cleaner to implement some complex
  async functions which take additional poll parameters.
  - An `await_with!` macro would be quite useful for implementing `await` loops
    on arbitrary `Poll`-returning functions.
    - Would be a good candidate for an `.await(args..)` syntax if very heavily
      used.
  - For example, an simple little checksumming async write wrapper might look
    like this:
```rust,ignore
|ctx: &mut Context, bytes: &[u8]| -> Poll<usize> {
  let mut checksum = 0;
  let mut count = 0;
  pin_mut!(writer);

  loop {
    let n = 4096 - count;
    if n == 0 {
      await_with!(writer.poll_write, ctx, &[checksum]);
    }

    let part = &bytes[..bytes.len().min(n)];
    checksum = part.fold(checksum, |x, &y| x ^ y);
    await_with!(writer.poll_write, ctx, part);

    count += part.len();
    yield Ready(part.len());
  }
}
```

## Try

- All proposals work fine with the `?` operator without even trying (haha).
- `Poll<Result<_, _>>` and `Poll<Option<Result<_, _>>>` already implement `Try`!
- Generators usually want a totally different `?` desugar that does `yield Some(Err(...)); return None;` instead of `return Err(...)`.
  - This comes up a lot in discussions of general coroutine syntaxes but just
    muddies things up because (say it with me) generators ≠ coroutines.
  - Sugar-free implementation is easy: `yield Some(try { ... }); None`
- Try blocks in general are super useful for handing errors by moving into
  specific error-handeling states.

## Language similarity

- Rust's version of coroutines can be a bit unusual compared to other languages.
  But the reason for this is simple: you need arguments to resume Rusty
  coroutines.
- Resume arguments in other languages can be passed just fine by sharing mutable
  data. So all they need to implement are generators, not true coroutines as
  defined here.

```python
# Generator function takes a word list and name on construction.
# The shared list is mutated to make room for new words.
def write_greeting(name, words):
    words.append('hello')
    if words.is_full:
        yield
    words.append(name)

```

```rust,ignore
// Function only needs name to construct coroutine.
// Coroutine gets mutable access to the word list each resume.
fn write_greeting(name: String) -> impl FnMut(&mut Vec<String>) {
  |words| {
    words.push("hello".to_string());
    if words.len() == words.capacity() {
      yield
    }
    words.push(name);
  }
}

```

## Language complexity

- The main selling point of [MCP-49][3] is that it avoids adding a whole new language feature with associated design questions. Instead, the common answer to questions regarding MCP-49 is that yield-closures simply do whatever closures do.
  - The syntax is the same.
  - Captures work the same way.
  - Arguments are passed the same way.
  - Return and yield both drop the latest arguments and then pop the call stack.
  - The only big difference is that once `yield` is involved, some variables get
    stored in a witness struct rather than in the stack frame. Plus the need for
    a poison state.
- In fact, `return` behaves exactly like a simultaneous `yield` + `break 'closure_body`.
  - In a sense, every closure already has a single yield point at which it
    resumes after `return`.
  - A `yield` adds a second resume point: hence the need for a discriminant.
- Under that proposal, anywhere a closure can be used, a coroutine can too. And
  vice versa.

## Generator unification

- So far in this proposal, I've been very careful to distinguish generators (as
  supported by the propane and async_stream crates, proposed by [RFC-2996][4],
  etc) from the coroutines discussed here. They are treated as two separate
  language features.
- Does Rust have "room" for both stream syntax and a generator syntax? Would it
  be better to find a single solution to both?
- A single solution is difficult for a few reasons:
  - Taking resume arguments muddies the syntax. For example, what would be the
    syntax for a generator function which takes an explicit resume argument?
  - The closure syntax works great for coroutines which implement `Fn*` a la
    [MCP-49][3]! But reusing that syntax to magically implement `Iterator` or
    `Stream` would cause confusion.
  - On that note, generators *definitely* want to implement different traits vs
    coroutines. `Iterator` and `Stream` rather than `Fn` or (ironically)
    `Generator`.
  - As stated above, async coroutines don't make much sense: async interacts
    poorly with resume arguments.
  - Async generators are super important, don't care about resume arguments.
  - As mentioned in the section on try, generators and coroutines generally want
    different error handling. Or at lest, some more complex `?` desugar is not
    so obvious for coroutines in general as it is for generators specifically.
- Once generalized coroutines are in place, a generator syntax like the one in
  [RFC-2996][4] is a trivial sugar on top:
```rust,ignore
gen {
  for item in inner {
    for mapped in func(item) {
      yield mapped;
    }
  }
}

// becomes

std::iter::from_fn(|| {
  for item in inner {
    for mapped in func(item) {
      yield Some(mapped);
    }
  }
  None
})
```
```rust,ignore
async gen {
  while let Some(item) = inner.next().await {
    yield func(item).await;
  }
}

// becomes

std::stream::from_fn(|ctx| {
  while let Some(item) = await_with!(inner.next(), ctx) {
    yield Ready(Some(await_with!(func(item), ctx)));
  }
  Ready(None)
})
```
- Proc-macro crates could provide very satisfactory `gen` and `gen_async` macros
  until we are sure of the need to support such a sugar directly in language as
  a keyword or in core as a first-party macro.
