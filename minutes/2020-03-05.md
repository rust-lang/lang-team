        - recommended option from the POV of the summary maker and why :)
        - what options have been evaluated and what were the results
        - what options exist that have not been evaluated and what are the pros/cons
        - Not done yet.
- Niko to reach out to Aaron Hill about experimenting with the other approach to never type fallback
- simulacrum to post a comment on #67058 asking whether libs will stabilize them
- scottmcm to post a comment on RFC 2585 with consensus below and/or talk to Ralf
## Upcoming design meetings
- [~~Feb 3 — Specialization infomercial (presented by Niko)~~](https://github.com/rust-lang/lang-team/blob/master/design-meeting-minutes/2020-02-03-specialization-review.md)
- ~~Feb 10 — Ralf +~~ `~~UnsafeCell~~` ~~bugs (~~[~~#55005~~](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/55005)~~,~~ [~~#68206~~](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/68206)~~)~~
    - [Notes uploaded here (along with video)](https://github.com/rust-lang/lang-team/blob/master/design-meeting-minutes/2020-02-10-References-and-dereferenceable.md)
    - **Question:** Would someone care to take a stab at “summarizing”? Maybe writing a comment on the MMIO in particular that summarized the impact there? — Niko will try
- ~~Feb 17 — (Niko is unavailable)~~
- March 9 —  (nothing)
- March 16 — ffi-unwind
- March 23 — ?? (maybe sealed rust? I am reaching out to James Munns)
- March 31 — ?? (maybe UCG or maybe something around lang team procedures? not sure)
- List of potential topics for March:
    - lang team procedures
    - Specification / sealed rust
    - Unsafe code guidelines — how to make progress
    - “Copy out of references” — focus on use cases and inter-related problems
        - `let foo: &Option<u32>; match foo { Some(x) => bar(x), None => ... }`
        - `fn bar(x: u32)`
            - `x` has type `&u32` which is annoying
        - Are there examples / use cases where the fix is more complex than inserting an `&` into a pattern?


## Shepherded item updates

**inline assembly (Amanieu, Josh)**

- conflict that we need to resolve: [project group creation RFC](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/issues/2836#issuecomment-565269781) 
- Current status:
    - Centril has open concern
    - Niko posted [comment with responses to the points within](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/2836#issuecomment-594880970)
        - Requesting lang-team members to actively second Centril’s concerns if they are shared (or if you feel they are not fully understood)
        - Requesting comments in the [summary doc containing those responses](https://paper.dropbox.com/doc/Inline-Assembly-Project-Group-Summary--AvhcrZk8~TmJrEdD8KJMOGwLAg-y3iM67MZEJL5zV6luPRbB) to help highlight incompleteness or inaccuracies
    - Closed and re-opened the `asm!` RFC to summarize prior thread
        - New RFC is https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/2873
        - Collecting feedback that was not included in the RFC
    - Implementation of proposed `asm!` macro is done

**safe transmute (Ryan, Josh)**

- May try to start with a simplified proposal
- Start with smallest set of things we can ask the language to do
    - e.g. maybe some kind of trait for “any bit pattern is acceptable”
    - can maybe build on the mechanisms we have for “these types allow zero” that is used to make `mem::zeroed` panic
        - question: is this a precise test, or is it conservative, and is it conservative in the right way?
            - currently it doesn’t panic on some types (e.g., bool) for back-compat concerns
            - more of a general inspiration
- conversations happening in #project-safe-transmute on Zulip

**const evaluation (ecstatic-morse)**

- no updates right now

**ffi-unwind (BatmanAod)**

- meeting scheduled for Mar 16 now
- [initial blog post available](https://blog.rust-lang.org/inside-rust/2020/02/27/ffi-unwind-design-meeting.html)
    - subsequent discussion concluded that “option 1” is strictly worse than “option 2”
    - key question to resolve:
        - should we have a “C unwind” or permit unwinding in the current “C” ABI?
    - did not end up gathering performance data since current proposal does not have implications

**"dyn Trait" stuff (nikomatsakis)**

- Relevant issue: [rust-lang/rust#57893](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/57893)
- Relevant PR: [rust-lang/rust#66037](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/66037)
- What the PR implemented:
    - Making `dyn Trait` not `dyn safe` if:
        - there is a dyn overlapping impl and 
        - the trait has associated non-functions
            - that do not have where `Self: Sized` (not implemented)
- Crater impact virtually negligible, but the 1 item we did identify is interesting
    - has to do with the `[TryStream](https://docs.rs/futures/0.3.1/futures/stream/trait.TryStream.html)` [trait](https://docs.rs/futures/0.3.1/futures/stream/trait.TryStream.html),  which is used roughly like this:
    trait StreamX {
        type Item;  
    }
    
    trait TryStreamX: StreamX  {
       type Ok;
       type Error;
    }
    
    impl<S, T, E> TryStreamX for S
        where S: ?Sized + StreamX<Item = Result<T, E>>
    {
        type Ok = T;
        type Error = E;
    }
- the crate in question has a `dyn TryStream` which is an error now
    - Why? The concern is that `S` in the above impl might (in the future) become
        - `dyn TryStreamX<Ok = A, Error = B> + StreamX<Item = Result<C, D>>`
    - in which case `type Ok` would be `A` from the default impl but `C` from the impl above
- I’m not sure if there is some path forward apart from breaking `dyn TryStream`, which is a bit of a shame
    - note that a trait alias is really what we *want* here
- other alternative that I haven’t tried to implement yet, but which I discussed before
    - in a dyn-overlapping impl, all associated items must be `default`
        - and compiler (for backwards compatibility) will add the `default` implicitly
            - (but user would not be permitted to specialize with their own impls, as boats noted)
        - this is to reflect that the compiler introduces its own impl
    - but impact on `TryStream` would be pretty severe here, I think
        - you wouldn’t be able to take `T: Stream<Item = Result<...>>`
        - you would not be able to do `T::Ok` 
- impact of existing PR
    - you cannot use `dyn TryStream` but you can do `fn foo<T: TryStream<..>>()>`
    - you could write `dyn Stream<Item = ..>`
- really this code wants to be a *trait alias* 
    - This would require trait aliases to support associated types, but that seems feasible
    - Trait alias semantics: “A Stream of Result<T, E> can be called a TryStream, where the associated types Ok and Error refer to T and E respectively”
- next step:
    - revisit the soundness hole and see if we can “weaponize” the `TryStream` example in a similar way
    - revisit the write-up covering the various options before us:
        - i.e., this change is modifying what dyn safety means, has very slight impact
            - concerns about the fact that “whether trait X is dyn safe depends on its impls”
        - other options might be introducing `default`, but this has potentially broader impact

**grammar (qmx)**

- Centril + petrochenkov have been working on parser architecture
    - simplified and unified item grammar for example in different contexts

`**never_type**` **(**`**!**`**) stabilization (nikomatsakis)**

- [PR #68350](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/68350) remains open but we are [losing faith in the approach](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/68350#issuecomment-579059372) that was initially suggested
- Problem is that a function like
    - `fn make_foo<T>() → Result<(), T> { Ok(()) }` is fundamentally fine
    - but if the `T` happened to “fall back” to `!`, we would issue a warning here
- Aaron1011 proposed a more aggressive lint that works across functions
    - Niko has stated he’d prefer a [more modular (intraprocedural) analysis](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/68350#issuecomment-579120263)

[**Nominated PRs**](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pulls?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Apr+label%3AI-nominated+label%3AT-lang)

    - No new developments

[**Nominated issues**](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3AI-nominated+label%3AT-lang+)

- [~~`is_x86_feature_detected!("avx512f")` fails to build on nightly~~](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/68905)
- [Arc::drop has a (potentially) dangling shared ref #55005](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/55005)
    - had a [design meeting](https://github.com/rust-lang/lang-team/blob/master/design-meeting-minutes/2020-02-10-References-and-dereferenceable.md) but didn’t reach a firm conclusion
    - **next step:** somebody needs to write up the implications of that meeting for this issue in a clear way
    - a possible next step: adding support for `*const self` methods so that we can have a `fetch_sub` on `AtomicUsize` that takes `*const self`
        - would have to deal with conflicts of inherent methods
        - could either deprecate existing `fetch_sub` or *try* to modify them in place
    - or we could make free-functions instead of methods
    - raw pointer variants would have to be unsafe, which is also unpleasant
        - what we really want is something that is valid on entry but not on exit
        - which we don’t have, unless we modify the guarantees of `&`
        - might be possible to have a wrapper type that’s a pointer internally but safe to construct from a reference — which we could also have methods on, to avoid the raw pointer method conversation
- [floating point to integer cast can cause undefined behaviour #10184](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/10184)
    - [last time we talked](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/10184#issuecomment-559538629), we concluded that it made sense to
        - adopt saturated semantics as the default
        - maybe offer a `-Z` flag to opt out for a time
        - there has been plenty of discussion in the meantime
        - how do we go forward here?
            - a summary might be an amazing contribution --niko
    - Centril will leave comment (see action items)
    - one concrete step is to ask libs to stabilize [the unsafe methods](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/67058) that allow you to do the casts (making it UB if they are wrong)
        - simulacrum to post a comment on #67058

[**Nominated RFCs**](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pulls?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Apr+label%3AI-nominated+label%3AT-lang)

- RFC for unsafe blocks in unsafe fn [#2585](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/2585)
    - lints being discussed are allow by default
    - RFC should be needed for changing people’s expected code patterns
    - consensus:
        - suggest changing the RFC to change lint defaults at the edition boundary to encourage this
            - this permits `#[allow]` in narrow places to overcome ergonomic hit
            - we can consider moving to hard error in next edition if we care
        - not block or consider changes to keywords at this time
            - not obvious that `trusted` is the right new keyword to add anyway
            - you might want it for today’s `unsafe fn foo() { /* body permits unsafe code */ }` for example
    - scottmcm to post a comment with above consensus and/or talk to Ralf

[**rfcbot pending list**](https://rfcbot.rs/)

- items to discuss this meeting:
    - RFC Elide Array Size stalled since [Dec 2018](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/2545#issuecomment-449133335)
        - various pending concerns:
            - general-value-inference ([#2545 (comment)](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/2545#issuecomment-449146388)) — centril
            - rfc-is-vague-or-maybe-niko-is-just-lazy ([#2545 (comment)](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/2545#issuecomment-449134514)) — niko
            - state-contextual-constraints-up-front ([#2545 (comment)](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/2545#issuecomment-477941629)) — felix
        - move to postpone?
        - goal:
            - want to write something like this
                - `static X: [u32; _] = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];`
            - would be a change in precedent against “global type inference”
                - already have made step in this direction with `impl Trait` 
        - one possibility:
            - say that we will permit `_` in “some places in the types of statics/constants”
                - we can say e.g. any value position, to limit interaction with `i32` and `!` fallback
            - but we do require that there is a DAG so that the type of each static/constant can be fully inferred before those who reference it are type-checked
            - this would permit future expansion in theory to permit `_` in other places if we wanted it
        - Niko’s thought:
            - we should close as postponed and state that we might prefer a proposal like that :)
        - The `_` is in its own infcx so it would need some work to get `_ == 2`
    let x: [u8; _] = [0, 1];
    - Calling methods on generic parameters of const fns #2632 ([fcp comment](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/2632#issuecomment-481395097))
        - As far as I know we are permitting experimentation and implementation to go through here
        - Can we merge the RFC in an experimental state? How can we best reflect this status?
    - merge: [**Introduce the ASM project group (rust-lang/rfcs#2836)**](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/issues/2836#issuecomment-565269781)
        - [Centril](https://rfcbot.rs/fcp/Centril)
